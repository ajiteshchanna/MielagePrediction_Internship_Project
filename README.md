# MielagePrediction_Internship_Project
This is an online internship project where I have build a model using the RandomForestRegressor to predict the Mielage  of a Vehicle using various parameters like horsepower, no. of cylinders, weight, acceleration and displacement. This is an example of Multiple Linear Regression problem.
